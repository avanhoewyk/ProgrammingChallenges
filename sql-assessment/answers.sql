# SQL Challenge

The database contains three tables: marketing_performance, website_revenue, and campaign_info. Refer to the CSV
files to understand how these tables have been created.

`marketing_performance` contains daily ad spend and performance metrics -- impression, clicks, and conversions -- by campaign_id and location:
```sql
create table marketing_data (
 date datetime,
 campaign_id varchar(50),
 geo varchar(50),
 cost float,
 impressions float,
 clicks float,
 conversions float
);
```

`website_revenue` contains daily website revenue data by campaign_id and state:
```sql
create table website_revenue (
 date datetime,
 campaign_id varchar(50),
 state varchar(2),
 revenue float
);
```

`campaign_info` contains attributes for each campaign:
```sql
create table campaign_info (
 id int not null primary key auto_increment,
 name varchar(50),
 status varchar(50),
 last_updated_date datetime
);
```

### Challenge Submit Instructions

1. Fork the repository
2. Answer the questions below in a single SQL file - e.g answers.sql
3. Provide Link to Forked Repository to PMG PMG Talent Acquisition Team

### Please provide a SQL statement for each question

1. Write a query to get the sum of impressions by day.

```sql
SELECT SUM(impressions)
FROM marketing_performance
GROUP BY date;
```

2. Write a query to get the top three revenue-generating states in order of best to worst. How much revenue did the third best state generate?
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 state, revenue
FROM website_revenue ORDER BY revenue ASC;
```
The third best state was OHIO and they generated $37,577.

3. Write a query that shows total cost, impressions, clicks, and revenue of each campaign. Make sure to include the campaign name in the output.
```sql
SELECT FROM * website_revenue
NATURAL JOIN marketing_performance;

SELECT SUM(cost), SUM(impressions), SUM(clicks), SUM(revenue)
FROM marketing_performance
ORDER BY campaign_id;

SELECT FROM * campaign_info
NATURAL JOIN marketing_performance;

SELECT campaign_id, name
FROM marketing_performance
(CASE
WHEN campaign_id = 64441550 THEN name = Campaign1
WHEN campaign_id = 55304737 THEN name = Campaign2
WHEN campaign_id = 89363211 THEN name = Campaign3
WHEN campaign_id = 86363015 THEN name = Campaign4
WHEN campaign_id = 99058240 THEN name = Campaign5
END);
```

4. Write a query to get the number of conversions of Campaign5 by state. Which state generated the most conversions for this campaign?

```sql
SELECT COUNT (conversions)
FROM marketing_performance
WHERE campaign_id = 99058240
ORDER BY geo;

 SELECT campaign_id, name
FROM marketing_performance
(CASE
WHEN campaign_id = 99058240 THEN name = Campaign5
END);
```
Georgia generated the most conversions for Campaign5 with 672 conversions. 

5. In your opinion, which campaign was the most efficient, and why?

```sql
SELECT FROM * website_revenue
NATURAL JOIN marketing_performance;

SELECT SUM(revenue) - SUM(cost)
FROM marketing_performance
ORDER BY campaign_id ASC;
```
Campaign 5 was the most efficient because it cost only $582.45 and earned a revenue of $45468. This means the company was able to profit $44885.55.
**Bonus Question**

6. Write a query that showcases the best day of the week (e.g., Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.) to run ads.

```sql
SELECT date
FROM marketing_performance
WEEKDAY((date))
ORDER BY impressions;
```
